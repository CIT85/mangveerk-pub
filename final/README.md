## Hero Image Design
**Why I chose the image**  
I selected a wide hero image featuring a highway and an NS Express truck to immediately communicate the company’s core service — over-the-road freight. The image conveys motion and reliability.

**Where it appears**  
The hero appears at the top of `index.html` (the homepage) as a large background image behind the site title and primary call-to-action.

**Design choices**  
- `background-size: cover` ensures the image fills the header area across devices.  
- `background-position: center center` keeps the truck / road centered for aesthetic balance.  
- Overlaid text uses high-contrast colors (white + gold CTA) to remain legible over the image.  
- Hero padding and a darkened overlay (image itself can be edited) ensure text legibility on small screens.

## Hero Image Design

For the hero image, I chose a high-resolution, vibrant photograph that immediately conveys the theme of the website. I wanted an image that captures attention while setting the tone for the user experience.  

The hero image appears at the top of the homepage, serving as the first visual element users see when they visit the site. Its prominent placement ensures it draws attention and provides context for the content below.  

In terms of design, I centered the image and applied a subtle overlay to improve contrast with the text placed on top. I used responsive sizing to ensure the image looks good on all devices, from mobile screens to large desktops. I also considered the layout, making sure the focal point of the image aligns with the main headline and call-to-action buttons. This combination of placement, layout, and contrast ensures the hero section is visually appealing and user-friendly.
